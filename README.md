# pagila-midterm

**Due Date:**

Sunday, 21 March at midnight.
There are no extensions for this assignment.

**Collaboration Policy:**

You may not collaborate with any human on this assignment.

You are allowed to reference any non-human resource created before the midterm was assigned.
In particular, you are encouraged to reference:
1. postgresql,
1. your previous assignments,
1. the class notes,
1. and online references.

**Instructions:**

The instructions are essentially the same as for the pagila homeworks:

1. Fork this repository.

1. There are 5 problems in the midterm, each in a separate file in the `sql` folder.
   Each problem is worth 6 points, and the midterm is worth 30 points overall.

   For each problem, write the answer in the .sql file just like you did in the homeworks.
   There is no `expected` output for you to compare your answers against, and no test cases.
   (I will grade your answers manually.)

1. Commit your changes and push them to github.
   Submit a link to your repo to sakai, along with the statment:
   ```
   I have not collaborated with anyone on this midterm.
   ```
